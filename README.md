# custom-linux-shell
Custom linux shell with built-in commands (prompt, pwd, cd and exit). 

prompt command changes the shell prompt from the default ($) to the string input after the prompt command. If there is no input after prompt command, the prompt will be changed to the default prompt. 

For example: 

$ prompt john$ 

john$ 

pwd and cd commands functions similarly to the command provided by the Bash built-in command. 

exit command will end the program.
